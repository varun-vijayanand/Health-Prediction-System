# Health-Prediction-System

This project aims to predict the health status of a patient using facial features. We will implement feature selection techniques like Principal Component Analysis, Local Binary Pattern, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Gabor FIlter. The machine learning models- Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Neural Network, and K-Nearest Neighbors will be used for deducing predictions.
